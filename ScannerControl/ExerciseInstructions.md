# Using the scanner control in Canvas Apps!

In this exercise, you will learn how to use the **Scanner Control** in Power Apps to scan barcodes and extract barcode numbers. The scanner control allows you to scan different types of barcodes and use the extracted barcode data in your app.

Follow the steps below to configure the scanner control and extract barcode numbers.

---

## Prerequisites

- A Power Apps account.
- A canvas app (you can create one or use an existing app).
- Access to Power Apps Studio.

---

## Step 1: Open or Create a Canvas App

1. **Open Power Apps Studio**:
    - Go to [https://make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com) and sign in.
    - Select **Apps** from the left navigation pane.
    - Open an existing canvas app or create a new one by selecting **+ New app** > **Canvas app**.
    - If creating a new app, select the layout (e.g., **Tablet** or **Phone**) as needed.

---

## Step 2: Add the Barcode Scanner Control

1. **Insert the Scanner Control**:
    - In the app editor, select the **Insert** tab from the top ribbon.
    - Scroll down or search for **Barcode Scanner** under the **Media** section.
    - Click on **Barcode Scanner** to insert it into your app.

2. **Position the Control**:
    - Drag the **Barcode Scanner** control to a desired location on the screen.
    - Resize it as necessary.

3. **Set the Properties of the Scanner Control**:
    - By default, the barcode scanner control can scan various types of barcodes (e.g., QR codes, UPC codes, etc.). You can configure the scanner to extract barcode numbers.

    **Optional**: Limit the scanner to specific barcode types (if needed) by setting the `BarcodeType` property of the scanner. Example:
    ```powerapps
    Scanner1.BarcodeType = BarcodeType.UPCA // For UPC-A barcode only
    ```

    **Note**: Leave this property empty or default if you want to support all barcode types.

## Step 3: Display the Scanned Barcode Number

1. **Add a Label to Display the Barcode Number**:
    - In the app editor, go to **Insert** > **Label** to add a label to the screen.
    - Place the label near the barcode scanner for easy viewing.

2. **Set the Label to Display the Scanned Barcode**:
    - Select the label control.
    - In the **Text** property of the label, set the value to display the barcode number scanned by the barcode scanner control:
    ```powerapps
    Text = Scanner1.Value
    ```

    This will display the extracted barcode number once the user scans a barcode using the scanner.

---

## Step 4: Add a Button to Trigger the Scanner

1. **Insert a Button Control**:
    - In the **Insert** tab, select **Button** and place it next to the barcode scanner.
    - Set the button text to something like "Scan Barcode" to let the user know what it does.

2. **Configure the Button to Trigger the Scanner**:
    - Select the button and, in the **OnSelect** property, set the action to start the scanner:
    ```powerapps
    OnSelect = Scanner1.Scan()
    ```

    When the user clicks this button, the barcode scanner will open, and the camera will scan for barcodes.

## Step 5: Handle Scanned Data

1. **Use the Scanned Barcode Number**:
    - Once the barcode number is scanned, you can use the extracted data in your app for various purposes, such as looking up products, storing the barcode in a database, or displaying additional information.

    For example, you can store the scanned barcode value in a collection or variable for future use. In the **OnScan** property of the scanner control, you can add:
    ```powerapps
    OnScan = Set(ScannedBarcode, Scanner1.Value)
    ```

    This stores the scanned barcode number in a variable called `ScannedBarcode`. You can then use this variable throughout the app.

2. **Display the Stored Barcode in a Label** (Optional):
    - You can display the stored barcode number in another label by setting its **Text** property to:
    ```powerapps
    Text = ScannedBarcode
    ```

---

## Step 6: Test the Scanner Control

1. **Test in Power Apps Studio**:
    - Press **Play** to run the app in preview mode.
    - Click the **Scan Barcode** button. The scanner will open, allowing you to scan a barcode using your device's camera.
    - Once a barcode is scanned, the barcode number should appear in the label on the screen.

2. **Test on a Mobile Device**:
    - Save and publish the app.
    - Open the Power Apps app on your mobile device, and run the app.
    - Click the **Scan Barcode** button to trigger the scanner and scan a barcode.
    - The barcode number should display in the label on the screen.

---

## Step 7: Additional Customizations (Optional)

1. **Error Handling for Failed Scans**:
    - If you want to handle scenarios where a scan fails or the barcode is not recognized, you can add error handling in the **OnScanFailed** property of the scanner control:
    ```powerapps
    OnScanFailed = Notify("Scan failed. Please try again.", NotificationType.Error)
    ```

    This will notify the user if a barcode scan is unsuccessful.

2. **Limit Barcode Types (Optional)**:
    - You can limit the barcode scanner to accept specific barcode types only. For example, if you're scanning QR codes only, set the `BarcodeType` property of the scanner:
    ```powerapps
    Scanner1.BarcodeType = BarcodeType.QR
    ```

    This will restrict the scanner to QR codes only.

3. **Perform Lookup Based on Scanned Data** (Optional)**:
    - If you're scanning a barcode to look up information from a data source (e.g., a product catalog), you can trigger a lookup function after scanning the barcode. For example, if you have a **Products** table with a **Barcode** column, you can set the **OnScan** property to search for the product:
    ```powerapps
    OnScan = Set(ScannedProduct, LookUp(Products, Barcode = Scanner1.Value))
    ```

    This searches for the product in the **Products** table where the **Barcode** matches the scanned barcode number.

## Summary

By following these steps, you will be able to:
- Add the **Scanner Control** to a canvas app.
- Use it to scan and extract barcode numbers from any barcode.
- Display the scanned barcode on the screen and handle the scanned data for additional functionality.

This setup is useful for building apps that involve inventory management, product lookup, or any other scenario where barcode scanning is required.
